# Code of Conduct

In a Code of Conduct you discuss with each other what you expect from each other and from the collaboration.  
Everyone participates in this and supports the agreements that you draw up together. A Code of Conduct is a flexible document.  
If after some time it appears that certain agreements are not realistic or applicable, then it is important to discuss this  
in the group and adjust the agreements if necessary.

## Assignment description:

> In your own words, describe what you need to do as a group in this course.

Throughout this course our team is going to have 2 main goals, the first one being to **implement the project** as described during the Client Q&A lectures, and the second one is to acquire and improve **soft skills** and to become a **better team** in the process.

Our first goal entails implementing a **quiz game** which revolves around **energy usage and awareness**. The game will be able to be played in both **single and multiplayer modes**, while tracking the **highest score** of each player.

Furthermore the multiplayer mode is going to contain **additional features** to make the core game play more interesting and sophisticated, including but not limited to: jokers/power ups, emoji interaction.

Our second goal is closely related to the first one, as we are going to achieve our first goal through the **power of teamwork**. Some of the most important aspects we aim to practice are:

- equal work distribution
- frequent and constructive communication between the team members
- fostering an open and accepting environment, to facilitate a wide range of diverse ideas

## Target or ambition level:

> What grade are you working for?

**The bare minimum is an 8, yet we want the highest grade possible, so we will aim for a 10.**

In general our goal for the course is to complete the 2 tasks described in the previous section, that is:

1. Finish the project
2. Improve team work process and soft skills

### The project
To achieve our **first goal**, we are going to study the technologies and frameworks we are required to use. We are going to split the project into smaller bite-sized tasks, which we are going to distribute among the team member in an equal manner. Thus we expect that each team member does the part they are responsible for, and in case of difficulties it is encouraged that the given team member consults the others in the team.

Furthermore we are going to make use of tools like check-style to enforce a common coding style throughout the project. We are also going to aim to keep test coverage as high as possible.

As a means to improve code quality and performance frequent and constructive code reviews are going to be performed.

### The teamwork
Our second goal is for us to improve our soft skills and to become better team members in the process, as an extension the team as a whole is also going to improve in efficiency and communication.

We are going to achieve these goals, by keeping an open mind for each others' ideas, and giving everyone the time and opportunity during meetings to voice their opinions.

Furthermore we are going to give each other constructive feedback in the form of code reviews, and at meetings for general non-code related tasks, such as creating documents and completing individual assignments.

Lastly equal work distribution is something the team takes very seriously, therefore we have created issues in such a way, where everyone is able to contribute, thanks to small bite-sized tasks, additionally we have assigned weights to each issue. This means we can quantify the effort of each team member, to make sure contribution is done in an equal way.

The weight of an issue is determined according to the following procedure:
 - If the priority of the issue is **must have**, then the weight is 21-30
 - If the priority of the issue is **should have**, then the weight is 11-20
 - If the priority of the issue is **could have**, then the weight is 1-10

The exact weight an issue gets within the specified range is subjectively determined by the members of the team, based on the importance of the given task.

## Products:

> What should you deliver at the end? On which platform do you share which documents (Discourse/Miro/MS Teams)?  
What standards must the work submitted meet?

At the end of the course we need to deliver the project itself and supporting documents including, but not limited to: 

- teamwork assignments
- the HCI report
- this code of conduct

By *the project* we specifically mean that our project source code will be available on the GitLab repository of the team. Additionally we are going to be able to do a demonstration of application. What exactly the project is, is described in the first section, and also through our issues and backlog file.

Regarding the sharing of documents the following rules apply:
- **Source code**: This is going to be shared through GitLab, adhering to the *GitLab best practices*, contained in the notes of the **Week 3 meeting**
- **Documents**: The preferred format for documents is **Markdown**, because it is nicely supported on GitLab and is an easy to edit text based file. When applicable these documents are uploaded to GitLab. More commonly the team shares documents (and drafts of documents) through the team's **Discord** server. Some documents need to be placed on **Brightspace**, in this case the document needs to be uploaded to brightspace and the file format specified by the given assignment needs to be used, most commonly: Markdown, PDF, Word. Furthermore some documents are shared to the private **Mattermost** group of the team, especially in case of feedback sent by the TA of the team.

The standard the work must meet varies based on the type of the work:
- **Documents**: In this case the most important aspect is eliminating spelling mistakes and correct use of English grammar. To this end all documents need to be spell checked before uploading/sharing the final version.
Furthermore the documents must use proper formatting, some of the criteria are:
    - Proper use of headings (respect the hierarchy of headings e.g. after h1 always use h2)
    - Use lists where possible
    - Use **bold** and *italic* formatting to make the text easier to read
- **Source code**: In this case there are several criteria the work has to meet:
    - The code must compile
    - The code must not break already existing code
    - The code must adhere to the check-style rules
    - The code must be tested, and pass previously added tests as well
    - The code must be reviewed and approved by 2 other team members before merging
        - The code must have good complexity (reviewers may use asymptotic complexity or empirical analysis to quantify this metric) 
        - The code must make use of the concepts used by the frameworks. This mainly includes proper use of dependency injection, not handling JSON manually, not using static variables etc. (other concepts introduced during lectures also apply here)

## Planning:

> How do you ensure that each group finishes everything on time?  
Did you clarify who will have a final say in the final deliverable and submits it to Brightspace _on behalf of the project group?_

### Deadlines
To ensure everything is finished on time we are going to make use of *Sprints* as introduced by the video on *SCRUM*. The main idea is that each week we take some of the items on our to-do list and make the goal to complete them during the week. Therefore the deadline is always going to be the end of the week.

To track the progress we are going to make use of GitLab's features such as milestones, and due-date for the milestones. The ensure equal work distribution weights are assigned to each issue.

To make sure everyone finishes on time, each team member can check on the progress of other team members on GitLab. We are going to incrementally check on each other at the half of the sprint and towards the end of the sprint.

Other than that, team members are always encouraged to seek the help of other members in case of difficulties.

### Submission
The group as a whole is going to decide democratically on the contents of the deliverable of the week. In the case where a consensus can not be reached the chairman of the week should have the power to make the final decision.

The job of uploading and the documents to Brightspace and/or GitLab is going to fall on the minute-taker of the week.

## Behavior:

> How do you treat each other in the group? How do you handle disagreements within your group?  
Could your guide or student assistant be involved in reaching consent?  
What do you do if someone is late during a group meeting?

It&#39;s common decency to treat all other members with respect and consider them as equals.  
If a disagreement occurs we can discuss the issues and then come to a compromise where all sides  
of the argument can be pleased. Student assistants should be a last resort since we should be able  
to resolve issues ourselves. Meetings should start even if someone is late.  
A single person shall not hold the group back and so the meetings may proceed regardless.

Furthermore we expect each team member to contribute equally to all tasks of the project. Regarding code, this has been described already in previous sections.

When it comes to documents this becomes a bit harder to enforce. In general we take the approach of brainstorming individually, then sharing and combining the results of the individual ideas to reach a common document.

As for work ethic expected of the members, we agree to adhere to the following principles:
* When the chairman of the week requests that members individually brainstorm, they are expected to come up with their own ideas, independent of other members
* Team members are expected to attend all meetings, unforeseen difficulties are of course an exception from this rule
* Team members are expected to finish issues assigned to them each week during the *sprint*
    - an issue may be treated as finished if it is merge to the `dev` branch
    - an issue is **not finished** if it is not reviewed by 2 other members, however in this case other team members who didn't review are at fault, not the author of the feature/fix
    - an issue is **not finished** if no merge request has been opened during the *sprint* for it
    - an issue is **not finished** if a code review requests changes and they are not responded to. In this case the fault falls on the author of the feature/fix

## Communication:

> In what ways do you communicate with each other as a group and among yourselves?  
(in the studio/MS Teams/Miro/Discourse)

Mostly Discord and on meetings, or mattermost if so required.

## Commitment:

> How do you determine the quality of each group member&#39;s work, so that each group members delivers the same quality?
> How do you measure the commitment of the chairs and minute takers?

To determine the quality of work done by individual group members a variety of methods and measurements are used depending on the type of work to be done.
This includes, but not limited to: code reviews, test coverage, check-style, spell checking, GitLab's pipeline.

The **Products** section further elaborates on the standards the submitted work must meet, and since we aim to deliver a high quality product, the standard described also describes the team's idea of *high quality*.

We must take turns for being chairman and minute takers.  
We will measure commitment simply through group satisfaction post-meetings.

## Meetings:

> How often will you meet as a group? What preparation is needed for the meetings?

As a minimum the team has agreed upon 2 weekly meetings. The usual time and date and place of these are as follows:

- Tuesday 13:45 or 15:45 (Time may vary) - On Campus Drebbelweg PC1 Cubicle 13 (Place may vary)
    - This meeting is mandatory for all members to attend
    - Attending online is also an option however our TA must be notified a day earlier at the latest, if possible
- Thursday 12:00 (Time and Date may vary) - Online through Discord
    - This meeting is mandatory for all team members (although not enforced by the course)
    - The Time and Date of this meeting may change depending on availability of team members

The scheduling of meetings is done usually during a meeting, this depends on personal availability, workload and deadlines. The 2 main factors are:
- Whether everyone is **available**
- Whether everyone agrees the meeting is **necessary**

As for preparation, we can't define anything strict here. The chairman is responsible for notifying the team of tasks that need to be prepared for the meeting such as:
- Individual brainstorming about an issue
- Getting individual assignments done
- Finishing a given issue on GitLab
- Modifying / Uploading a document

As we value having all team members participate in the meeting more than a having strict meeting dates and places we aim to be flexible with meetings as much as possible. This is limited with the mandatory Tuesday meeting, however the Thursday meeting is open to be rescheduled.

If additional meetings are needed the same rules apply when deciding the time and place of the meeting. In this case the team members all still expected to attend the meeting, however the team also realizes that these *ad-hoc* scheduled meetings may conflict with one or more members' personal agenda.

Canceling meetings is also a possibility however our first priority is to find a time and place such that every member is able to attend. In the case where this is not possible the meeting may be canceled if there are no time critical topics to discuss. In the case where there are some upcoming close deadlines and/or a timely and important decision needs to be made the meeting may be held with the members who are able to attend.

## Decision-making:

> How do you make decisions? By majority vote or by consensus?

Mostly through majority vote, but if the split is indeterminate then we may come to a consensus,  
though this also depends on the type of issue we wish to solve.

In any case when a decision is made every team member must comply with that decision. In case where a team member changes his/her mind discussing the issue again is an option, however until a new consensus is reached, everyone must follow the currently agreed upon decision.

## Dealing with conflicts:

> How do you handle conflicts within the group?

As mentioned in the previous section we take the approach of avoiding conflicts in the first place, by trying to reach a consensus, where every member of the team agrees.

However we realize that reaching a consensus may not always be possible, for this reason it is important to keep and open mind and listen to the opinion of each member of the team. In this case when there is absolute disagreement in the team, we must grant the week's chairman the power to make a final decision, with which  - according to the previous section - all team members must apply.

## Guidance:

> What do you expect from the teacher&#39;s and/or student assistant&#39;s guidance?  
What do you want feedback on, on the content or on the collaboration?

Tell us whether we are on track during the entirety on the project.  
Ideally we would request feedback on both the content and collaboration,  
though the latter has more weight, at least to our group.

## Consequences:

> What are the consequences if a participant in the group does not keep the agreements?

If a participant is stubborn with his decision to not take the group's interests seriously,  
and we are not able to convince him otherwise, then we have no other way to report that member,  
though let's hope that doesn't happen :)

## Success factors:

> What makes your team a dream team?

Everyone is respectful, we help each other through the entire journey,  
and make the entire experience enjoyable for everyone.
