# Code of Conduct

In a Code of Conduct you discuss with each other what you expect from each other and from the collaboration.  
Everyone participates in this and supports the agreements that you draw up together. A Code of Conduct is a flexible document.  
If after some time it appears that certain agreements are not realistic or applicable, then it is important to discuss this  
in the group and adjust the agreements if necessary.

## Assignment description:

In your own words, describe what you need to do as a group in this course.

- **Get accustomed to the technologies**

- **Improve soft/ team working skills**

- **Make sure everyone gives equal contribution to the project**

## Target or ambition level:

What grade are you working for?

**The bare minimum is an 8, yet we want the highest grade possible, so we will aim for a 10.**

## Products:

What should you deliver at the end? On which platform do you share which documents (Discourse/Miro/MS Teams)?  
What standards must the work submitted meet?

**All the documents in markdowns, a nice working game with a REST API and all other technologies.  
Intermediate exchange will go to Mattermost and Discord, while all the documents will go to GitLab.  
All documets must be of satisfactory quality for all team members.**

## Planning:

How do you ensure that each group finishes everything on time?  
Did you clarify who will have a final say in the final deliverable and submits it to Brightspace _on behalf of the project group?_

**Everyone should be able to help other team members when in need.  
We will let everyone agree with the final drafts of the documents,  
and for now it's** ***Alpi*** **that will upload the final versions of the documents.**

## Behavior:

How do you treat each other in the group? How do you handle disagreements within your group?  
Could your guide or student assistant be involved in reaching consent?  
What do you do if someone is late during a group meeting?

**It&#39;s common decency to treat all other members with respect and consider them as equals.  
If a disagreement occurs we can discuss the issues and then come to a compromise where all sides  
of the argument can be pleased. Student assistants should be a last resort since we should be able  
to resolve issues ourselves. Meetings should start even if someone is late.  
A single person shall not hold the group back and so the meetings may proceed regardless.**

## Communication:

In what ways do you communicate with each other as a group and among yourselves?  
(in the studio/MS Teams/Miro/Discourse)

**Mostly Discord and on meetings, or mattermost if so required.**

## Commitment:

How do you determine the quality of each group member&#39;s work, so that each group members delivers the same quality?

How do you measure the commitment of the chairs and minute takers?

**Appoint other members to review your code before merging changes to ensure maximum quality.**

**We must take turns for being chairman and minute takers.  
We will measure commitment simply through group satisfaction post-meetings.**

## Meetings:

How often will you meet as a group? What preparation is needed for the meetings?

**Two meetings per week should be a bare minimum, but we can and its actually recommended that we meet  
as often as possible so we can ensure that no team member is stuck for his part of the project  
and check on each other regurarly.**

## Decision-making:

How do you make decisions? By majority vote or by consensus?

**Mostly through majority vote, but if the split is indeterminate then we may come to a consensus,  
though this also depends on the type of issue we wish to solve.**

## Dealing with conflicts:

How do you handle conflicts within the group?

**Mostly through majority vote, but if the split is indeterminate then we may come to a consensus,  
though this also depends on the type of issue we wish to solve -   
the more serious the issues, the more dependent we will be on majority voting.**

## Guidance:

What do you expect from the teacher&#39;s and/or student assistant&#39;s guidance?  
What do you want feedback on, on the content or on the collaboration?

**Tell us whether we are on track during the entirety on the project.  
Ideally we would request feedback on both the content and collaboration,  
though the latter has more weight, at least to our group.**

## Consequences:

What are the consequences if a participant in the group does not keep the agreements?

**If a participant is stubborn with his decision to not take the group's interests seriously,  
and we are not able to convince him otherwise, then we have no other way to report that member,  
though let's hope that doesn't happen :)**

## Succesfactors:

What makes your team a dream team?

**Everyone is respectful, we help each other through the entire journey,  
and make the entire experience enjoyable for everyone.**
