# Week 4 meeting notes
2022 March 1 - 14:45 - on campus

## Reflection on learning topics
* Main learning topics covered over the past weeks:
    - Having a thorough understanding on the Spring framework.	
    - Learning how to use JavaFX to create rich client-side applications.

## HCI Draft feedback
* Based on the feedback on the HCI (draft) assignment provided by the TA on Mattermost.
* The feedback pointers to be adhered to in order to further refine the assignment work.
* To be noted that captions, tables and reference list do not count towards the overall word count of the paper.
* The 'methods' section of the HCI assignment requires shortening in order to adhere to the word count limitation.
* Referencing a lecturer's work in the paper:
    - We are required to find a publication about said topic that explains the underlying concept, and reference that.
    - Main takeaway is that the entire work should be understandable for a person reading it from the outside.

## Teamwork assignments 
* Assignment 4A: Team assignment, proper goal setting done by the chairman and secretary appointed.
* Assignment 4B: Individual assignment
    - Main focus: Feedback on ALL team mates.
    - This feedback will be shown anonymously, encouraging honesty in response.
    - Deadline: 11 March (Friday) 18:00
    - To be uploaded under Buddy Check

## Feedback on API endpoints
* All the 4 API endpoints have been processed and completed satisfactorily.
* All group members have a basic idea about how all the types of endpoints work.

## In-game questions
* The questions are to be uploaded in JSON format, after learning how to use the format through resources and videos.
* JSON can be used to transfer the questions from server to client.

## Issues for game development
* Group review of the issues is strongly recommended and the right way to go
    - Group members can review each other's work.
    - The approach is to set a common architecture/format for the issues
    - Group reviews can be coordinated and done via Discord.

## TA Input
* Feedback on API endpoints:
    - All 4 API endpoints are present. This requirement is satisfactorily cUompleted
* Feedback on testing requirements:
    - For tests on controllers and services, unit testing is made use of, which is correct.
    - For the UI, manual testing can be implemented.
    - Testing requirements: 1 or 2 tests per method.
* Line coverage: roughly 50-75% is acceptable.
* Javadoc usage in current code is satisfactory.
* Usage of services is upto the group, not a requirement.
* Milestones that expire should not be carried forward to the next week.
    - Milestones exist to check the group's progress weekly.
* Important deadlines:
    - HCI assignment (final version) : Friday, 4 March 23:59
    - Teamwork 4A (upload of meeting notes and agenda for week 4) : Friday, 4 March 18:00
    - Team question to be uploaded to the GitHub repository by this week.
    - Teamwork 4B (Buddy Check) : Friday, 11 March 18:00
* Demonstration of game: A demo version of the game is to be demonstrated in every meeting to the TA (and group members).
* No discrimination policy: 
    - To prevent discrimination against minority groups.
    - Strict no discrimination policy.
    - In case anyone faces mistreatment of such nature, it should be reported to the TA/lecturers.
* Exception handling in the application is not mandatory, but is generally helpful.

## Task distribution among group
* Roughly equal contribution (both in coding and in other parts of development) expected.
* Can be checked and verified by the TAs, so should be adhered to in the group.
* 14 hours of work per person per week is the recommended and expected amount. Major deviations from it should be avoided.
