## Asssignment 5b 

- Deadline 1 April 2022

## Feedback from Nada

- Refactor issues should have weights and the bug issues shouldn't.
- All evaluations are green this week.
- Continuous work and contribution: Rithik and Faizel should work a bit more.

### Recommendation

Start with manual testing of the UI this week/next week.

Start with the CSS baseline this week.

Start with the presentation, the draft video should be uploaded before next Friday.

## General discussion

- The game should have specific mode in which we can change the number of questions to answer.

- The sound feature could have two buttons which are the weird sound button and the normal sound button.
- The task distribution should be better.
- The presentation video should include 4 parts: Introduction, presentation, future improvements and conclusion.
