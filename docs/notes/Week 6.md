## Code of conduct

- Even though there were problems the last weeks with MRs we will not change the submission date but rather:
  * Be online Sunday so we can review the work.
  * Start work as early as possible (Monday) so we don't have this issue.
  * Do MRs during the week


## TA addition

- We should have more MR's per week.
- Better distribution of issues.
- If somebody opens a MR late, we are not expected to approve it
- Not enough code from Faizel, Rithik, and Yongcheng has problems.
- People that don't work enough should work more
- Faizel, Rithik, and Yongcheng need to send a very extensive plan to Nada on what they need to do.
- Internal deadline on when to complete MUST haves has been decided to be the end of this week.
