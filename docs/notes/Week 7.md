# Notes for week 7

22 March 2022 - 15:45 - on campus

## Asssignment 5b 

- Deadline 1 April 2022

## Feedback from Nada

- Some issues don't have a good description: 73, 58, 5 and 75.
- Major improvement on task distribution: red -> green.
- Continuous work and contribution: Rithik should work a bit more.
- Class structure: yellow flag - gamectrl too big and needs more documentation, the cyclomatic complexity is also too high.
- Server utils: split class into more util classes.
- Player: parsedAnswer should be removed.
- Code review: yellow flag -> Rithik and Yongcheng should do more reviews.
- Pipeline: Yongcheng should be more careful.

### Recommendation

Start with manual testing of the UI this week/next week.

Some people might receive an email about code contribution. 
If this email is received the group should send a formal plan on the week. 
Who is going to solve what?

## General discussion

- Don't do unrelated changes in your issue. Keep the MR/issue focused on the feature.
- Checkstyle: put the else on the same line as the closing bracket of the if.
- Comments and javadocs: don't over explain and don't put it on tests.
- GenericType: keep the generic type in.
